abstract: Signage display, which is used to convey message or information, has evolved from conventional to digital display. Conventional signage which may be hand written or printed papers are being wiped out by digital displays used by industries because of its attractive features of efficient involvement of consumers. However, extensive use of digital signage displays contributes a notable amount of power consumption (about 1000W for a 14inch Ã— 48inch display) of a region. In this literature, we have devised a novel approach for reducing power consumption of digital signage as well as satisfying human visibility by exploiting duty cycle. Our proposed technique is capable of relinquishing a significant amount (about 14.54% in comparison with existing display system) of power consumption occurred by digital display by keeping an eye on expected human vision.
