abstract: Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) has become the de facto communication protocol for theInternet of Things (IoT) and smart wearable devices for its ultra-low energy consumption, ease ofdevelopment, good enough network coverage, and data transfer speed. Due to the simplified design ofthis protocol, there have been lots of security and privacy vulnerabilities. As billions of health care, personalfitness wearable, smart lock, industrial automation devices adopt this technology for communication, itsvulnerabilities should be dealt with high priority. Some segregated works on BLE were performed focusingon various vulnerabilities, such as the insecure implementation of encryption, device authentication, userprivacy, etc. However, there has been no comprehensive survey on the security vulnerabilities of thisprotocol. In this survey paper, we present a comprehensive taxonomy for the security and privacy issuesof BLE. We present possible attack scenarios for different types of vulnerabilities, classify them accordingto their severity, and list possible mitigation techniques. We also provide case studies regarding howdifferent vulnerabilities can be exploited in real BLE devices.
